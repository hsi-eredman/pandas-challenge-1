After transforming and structuring the data, we can see that in spite of Client 33615 having the most orders, they actually appear last on the revenue generated. 
Quantity of units sold could be a decent indicator of profit if client 66037 proves to be an outlier.
Same for Revenue, but again if we can demonstrate that client 38378 is an outlier.
